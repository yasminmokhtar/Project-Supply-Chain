# Supply Chain Analysis & Visualization Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Microsoft Power BI Specialist Track** graduation requirements. It aims to evaluate and visualize the overall performance of a Supply Chain utilizing **Microsoft Power BI**. The report provides insights into inefficiencies and identifies opportunities for improvement across operations, manufacturing, and logistics.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
The main goal is to enable stakeholders to track key metrics, including:
- **Supply Chain Efficiency:** Monitoring order, manufacturing, and shipping processes.
- **Supplier Performance:** Identifying reliable suppliers and analyzing defect rates.
- **Transportation Optimization:** Comparing costs and shipping times across different modes (Air, Road, Sea, Rail).
- **Customer Demand:** Analyzing sales based on demographics and locations.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboarding.
- **Power Query:** For data cleaning and transformation (ETL).
- **DAX:** For creating measures and calculated columns.
- **Figma:** For designing the report layout and UI mockups.

## 📂 Data Model
The data is organized in a **Star Schema** containing:
- **Fact Table:** `Fact_SupplyChain` (Costs, Availability, Defect Rates, etc.).
- **Dimension Tables:** `Dim_Products`, `Dim_Customers`, `Dim_Location`, `Dim_Transportation`, `Dim_ShippingCarriers`.

## 📈 Dashboard Structure
The report consists of 6 comprehensive pages:
1. **Supply Chain Operations**
2. **Performance Overview**
3. **Product Performance**
4. **Supplier & Manufacturing**
5. **Transportation Overview**
6. **Customer Demographics**

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `supply_chain_V1.pbix` file using **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Explore the interactive visuals and filter data by product, location, or supplier.
